# solmate

Modern and opinionated building blocks for smart contract development.

## Acknowledgments 

These contracts were heavily inspired by and/or modified from many sources, primarily:

- [Dappsys](https://github.com/dapphub/dappsys)
- [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
- [Uniswap](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-lib)

## Another contract library?

Yes. Although OpenZeppelin contracts are wonderful and cover a lot of Solidity developer's needs, they are lacking in 3 key areas:

- Bloated
- Gas Inefficient 
- Not Opinionated Enough 
- **Not [DappTools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools) friendly**

Dappsys improves on those fronts, but also suffers from issues of its own:

- Dated Solidity practices
- Not comprehensive enough 

### Solmate seeks to solve these issues by introducing a catalogue of modern, opinionated, _gas efficient_ and [DappTools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools)-centric contracts that will fit perfectly into your next project.
